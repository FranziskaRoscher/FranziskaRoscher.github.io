<h4><strong>Why Women Vote: When and How Clientelism Closes the Gender
Turnout Gap (Book Project)</strong></h4>
<p>When do women turn out at equal rates to men? My dissertation
re-investigates this question in the context of developing countries.
Existing theories of women’s political participation are largely
resource-based, yet in many developing countries, women turn out at par
with men in the face of low levels of economic development and female
labor force participation, and despite gendered differences in
individual-level resource endowments. Based on an in-depth investigation
of India, I argue that there is a second path to women’s equal political
participation that does not rely on individual-level resources, but
instead depends on clientelism and household support for female turnout.
Where households are supportive, they can bridge the resource gap for
women. Household support, in turn, depends on high levels of clientelist
returns to a vote. I provide several pieces of empirical evidence from
India consistent with this theory, based on two original surveys and a
novel panel dataset on the clientelist party mobilization. I show that
female turnout is higher in a poorer and more clientelist state than in
a better developed but less clientelist state, and that household
support for female turnout – but not other forms of political
participation – is high under clientelism. I also demonstrate that
increases in levels of clientelist mobilization – measured as a rise in
the number of ethnic groups targeted by clientelist parties – leads to
smaller gender turnout gaps at the constituency level across several
states. My research has important implication for our understanding of
the relationship between development and female political participation,
as well as the consequences of clientelism.</p>

<h4><strong>How Clientelist Party Mobilization Closes the Gender Turnout
Gap: Theory and Evidence from India (JMP)</strong></h4>
<p>I argue that besides the traditional, resource-based explanations of
women’s participation, there is a second path to women’s equal electoral
participation that depends on clientelist mobilization of household
support for female turnout. Where households are supportive of women’s
participation, they can bridge the resource gap to enable female turnout
even in the most unlikely of contexts, namely where women face a lack of
resources and high costs to participation in public life. But households
will only be supportive were returns to a vote are high. I develop a
typology of clientelist regimes that posits that both the of the
clientelist exchange as well as the of the clientelist resources
determines the value of a vote. Returns to a vote should be highest when
clientelist parties rely on post-election resource sharing arrangements
that provide selective post-election access to state resources; and
lowest when clientelist parties instead bank on privately funded
electoral handouts. I test this theory in India, a particularly puzzling
case of gender turnout parity. I use the fact that in India, ethnicity
is politically salient and clientelist parties purposefully incorporate
ethnic groups into their leadership, while excluding others, to send
signals about the future distribution of state resources. Members of
ethnic groups who have a co-ethnic in any party’s leadership will expect
the highest returns to a vote, and therefore be most likely to support
female turnout. Using a novel panel dataset on the number and types of
ethnic groups incorporated into state-level party leadership of all
major parties for all state elections in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar
Pradesh from 1977 through 2007, I show that a) the number of ethnic
groups incorporated went up over time, and that b) a rise in the number
of politically incorporated ethnic groups before an election leads to a
drop in the gender turnout gap during the election.</p>

<h4><strong>Exclusion Before Elections: How Faulty Voter Lists
Disenfranchise Women in India</strong></h4>
<p>Voting is the most fundamental act of political participation in a
democracy, as well as the main mechanism for holding officials
accountable. The accuracy of voter lists -– the extent to which all
eligible adults are enrolled to vote and all ineligible individuals are
deleted from the list -– therefore is an indicator of the health of a
democracy. While under-enrollment and the extent of “deadwood” on voter
lists have come under considerable scrutiny in the United States, the
accuracy of electoral rolls in developing countries has not attracted
the same scholarly attention so far. I examine the quality of the
electoral roll in India, the world’s largest democracy, using original
data from two full village censuses and a large-scale voter survey. I
find that voter lists simultaneously show under-enrollment – that is the
disenfranchisement of eligible adults – as well as deadwood; and that
the deadwood masks part of the under-enrollment. This pattern is
starkest for women, particularly young women, who are most likely to
migrate in India and often dependent on family support for their voter
registration. The reason for the poor quality of voter lists, I argue,
lies in the incentive structure for low-level officers in charge of
maintaining the decentralized rolls.</p>

<h4><strong>Voting as a Family? Investigating Agency and Vote Choice in
India</strong> (with Rahul Verma, CPR, Delhi)</h4>
<p>How much agency do they hold over their vote choice? Research shows
that in many developing countries, individuals are socially and
economically dependent on the household; accordingly, household members
coordinate on a host of behaviors, including political participation.
Where intra-household bargaining power is gendered, women in particular
might therefore not exercise full agency over their vote. But how do we
measure agency over vote choice? In many developing countries, policy
preferences do not link neatly parties or candidates. Furthermore, in
clientelist settings, any kinds of political preferences might be best
served by the patron party. Consequently, it can be rational for all
family members to vote for the same party, <em>even if they differ
starkly on policy priorities</em>. Voting for the same party as other
household members, therefore, is not proof of a lack of women’s agency.
We overcome this problem by using a novel measure of
<em>preference-consistent voting</em> that checks whether women’s vote
is internally consistent, i.e., whether women voted in line with their
own stated policy preferences, or instead subordinate their own
preferences to other household members’ priorities. Contrary to
expectations based on the literature, we find that women no less likely
than men to vote in accordance with their stated preferences; that women
are no more likely than men to falsify their own preferences and vote
according to other household members’ preferences; and that household
disagreement on policy priorities does not predict women’s
preference-consistent voting.</p>

<h4><strong>Ethnic Identity Salience and Attitudes Toward
Women</strong></h4>
<p>Are political attitudes affected by which of their multiple ethnic
identities is most salient for a person? If each ethnic identity comes
with certain social norms that are practiced and enforced by an ethnic
group, then making one identity salient over another should restrict the
choice space of acceptable behavior and attitudes accordingly. I test
this theory using particularly meaningful attitudes: men’s attitudes
toward women’s political and economic participation, which have been
shown to affect women’s labor force participation and partaking in the
political process around the world. Using an original online survey
experiment in India, I show that it indeed matters which ethnic identity
is most salient for a man. Males who were primed on their religious
identity showed less support for women’s political and economic
participation than those in the control group. The results were less
clear-cut for the treatment that primed men on their caste identity:
while males self-identifying as Brahmins, members of other forward
castes or Dalits increased their support for women’s participation when
treated, men who belong to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) lowered
their support when treated.</p>

<h4><strong>The Challenge of Measuring the Gender Turnout
Gap</strong></h4>
Studies of women’s electoral participation face a major data constraint:
very few countries collect and publish gender-disaggregated turnout
data. Accordingly, previous scholarship mostly relied on survey data to
gauge women’s electoral participation relative to men’s, despite the
fact that survey respondents notoriously over-report having voted and we
know nothing about whether this behavior is gendered. I explore this
potential source of error by comparing a new dataset of administrative
turnout data disaggregated by gender and survey-based estimates of
turnout among men and women for about two dozen countries worldwide. I
find that men overreport their turnout at even higher rates than women,
obfuscating the gender turnout gap, that is, the difference between male
and female turnout rates. This finding has important implications for
scholars studying electoral participation, as survey results can either
hide or exaggerate actual gender differences in turnout.

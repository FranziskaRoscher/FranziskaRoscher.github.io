<h4><strong>Why Women Vote: When and How Clientelism Closes the Gender
Turnout Gap</strong> (Based on Dissertation)</h4>
<div style="display: flex;">
<div style="width:60%; margin-right:50px;">
<p>When do women turn out at equal rates to men? My book project
re-investigates this question in the context of developing countries.
Existing theories of women’s political participation are largely
resource-based, yet in many developing countries, women turn out at par
with men in the face of low levels of economic development and female
labor force participation, and despite gendered differences in
individual-level resource endowments. Based on an in-depth investigation
of India, I argue that there is a second path to women’s equal political
participation that does not rely on individual-level resources, but
instead depends on clientelism and household support for female turnout.
Where households are supportive, they can bridge the resource gap for
women. Household support, in turn, depends on high levels of clientelist
returns to a vote. I provide several pieces of empirical evidence from
India consistent with this theory, based on two original surveys and a
novel panel dataset on the extent of clientelist party mobilization. I
show that female turnout is higher in a poorer and more clientelist
state than in a better developed but less clientelist state, and that
household support for female turnout – but not other forms of political
participation – is high under clientelism. I also demonstrate that
increases in levels of clientelist mobilization – measured as a rise in
the number of ethnic groups targeted by clientelist parties – leads to
smaller gender turnout gaps at the constituency level across several
states. My research has important implication for our understanding of
the relationship between development and female political participation,
as well as the consequences of clientelism.</p>

<p>When are returns to a vote high enough to mobilize female turnout? I
develop a typology of clientelist regimes that posits that both the
<em>sequencing</em> of the clientelist exchange as well as the
<em>source</em> of the clientelist resources determines the value of a
vote. Returns to a vote should be highest when clientelist parties rely
on post-election resource sharing arrangements that provide selective
post-election access to state resources; and lowest when clientelist
parties instead bank on privately funded electoral handouts. I test this
theory in India, a particularly puzzling case of gender turnout parity.
I use the fact that in India, ethnicity is politically salient and
clientelist parties purposefully incorporate <em>some</em> ethnic groups
into their leadership, while excluding others, to send signals about the
future distribution of state resources. Members of ethnic groups who
have a co-ethnic in any party’s leadership will expect the highest
returns to a vote, and therefore be most likely to support female
turnout. Using a novel panel dataset on the number and types of
<em>ethnic group incorporation</em> into state-level party leadership of
all major parties for all state elections in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar
Pradesh from 1977 through 2007, I show that a) the number of ethnic
groups incorporated went up over time, with considerable spatial and
temporal variation; and that b) a rise in the number of politically
incorporated ethnic groups before an election leads to a drop in the
gender turnout gap during the election.</p>

<p>Faulty voter lists raise concerns about the health of democracy:
incomplete lists effectively disenfranchise eligible adults, while
inaccurate lists containing errors and deadwood potentially open the
door to voter fraud. Yet we know little about the quality of voter
registers outside of the U.S. Using two full village censuses and voter
list annotations, I investigate the completeness and accuracy of voter
list in India, the world’s largest democracy. I find that voter lists
simultaneously exhibit under-enrollment of eligible adults as well as
deadwood. Women and young adults were the most likely to be unenrolled.
By contrast, income, religion, and caste identity were uncorrelated with
voter registration. I trace how the perverse incentives faced by
street-level bureaucrats in charge of maintaining voter lists lead to
growing deadwood on the register and, as a consequence, to rising
under-enrollment. In addition, I provide evidence that patri-local
marriage norms, together with the hyper-local nature of voter lists, can
explain at least some of the gender gap in enrollment.</p>

<p>When women vote for the same party as male household members, does
this reflect coercion or independent choice? Evaluating women’s agency
in vote choice is especially difficult in non-programmatic party
systems, where distinct policy preferences can rationally lead to the
same party choice as men. I develop a measure of preference-consistent
voting that assesses whether individuals vote for the party they
themselves identify as most competent on the issue they prioritize most.
Using original dyadic survey data from India, I show that women vote as
preference-consistently as men, even when they disagree with male
household members. Among inconsistent voters, women are more likely to
align with other women than with men. Patterns of agreement in party
evaluations are consistent with symmetric persuasion rather than
gendered domination. These findings suggest that households function as
deliberative networks and demonstrate the value of measuring agency
through internal consistency rather than vote alignment.</p>

<p>Where girls receive less education than boys, they become
economically dependent on their households, leading to low
intra-household agency and, ultimately, adverse development outcomes for
themselves and their children. A major obstacle to girls’ education in
many developing countries is parents’ attitudes: On the one hand,
parents have incentives to invest in boys’ education, because sons are
responsible for taking care of them in old age. On the other hand,
social norms around girls’ future roles as wives and mothers as well as
around their purity and safety might actively discourage parents from
educating their daughters. We investigate one avenue for changing
parental attitudes towards girls’ education: elite messaging that
encourages parents to invest in their daughters’ education. In a
large-scale survey experiment (N=2,300) in rural Bihar, India, we vary
the gender and position of authority figures conveying endorsements and
capture parental dispositions toward girls’ education through a variety
of attitudinal and behavioral measures. We find that elite messages were
more effective when they came from male elites at lower tiers of
government. However, while elite messaging was able to shift parent’s
willingness to invest in girls’ education on the margins, none was able
to shift major aspirations on girls’ education, employment, or age at
marriage. Our research highlights the type of behavioral change that can
and cannot be molded by elite messaging in a setting with ingrained
social norms, even when state policies alleviate economic
constraints.</p>

<h4><strong>Girl Revolution? The Effect of Girls’ Empowerment Programs
on Social Gender Norms</strong></h4>
<div style="display: flex;">
<div style="width:60%; margin-right:50px;">
<p><em>(Data collection in progress)</em></p>
<p>Do girls’ empowerment programs have broader effects on social gender
norms? Some theories posit that girls who become educated, generate
income, and assert their rights might serve as role models for others
and generate positive spill-over effects. Other scholarship cautions
about backlash effects: females visibly breaking with traditional gender
norms might generate backlash from society, and in particular from
parents of other young girls. I partner with an NGO in rural Bihar, one
of India’s poorest and most gender-inequal states, that runs female
empowerment programs – providing education, income, and peer group
support to adolescent girls – to evaluate this. Using a
difference-in-differences approach with multiple survey waves, we
evaluate the effect of the program not just on the adolescents who take
part in it; but also on other girls in treatment villages, as well as
the mothers of young girls in villages where the program is active.</p>

<h4><strong>Work and the Vote: Does Welfare Expansion Improve
Turnout?</strong></h4>

<div style="display: flex;">
<div style="width:60%; margin-right:50px;">
<p><em>(Data collection in progress)</em></p>
<p>Does the expansion of the welfare state increase or depress political
participation in developing countries? In many developing countries,
where state capacity for taxation is low and wealth redistribution
therefore limited, the poor vote at higher rates than the rich because
it is easier (and cheaper) for political elites to motivate the poor to
turn out. Welfare provisions that improve the overall standard of
living, therefore, might make it harder for elites to elicit turnout. On
the other hand, prior research suggests that higher welfare provisions
make the state more visible to ordinary citizens, particularly in rural
areas, and therefore drive up expectations of political responsiveness
and benefit provision. This could motivate more citizens to turn out to
voice their demand for new (or continuing) benefits. We leverage the
staggered rollout of India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
(NREGS), the largest public works program in the world, to test whether
positive income shocks for rural laborers affected turnout.</p>
